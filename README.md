Smart Injection System



1. Interface for Connecting Syringes

    Universal Adapter: Design a universal adapter that can attach to various syringe types. This could be achieved through a flexible, adjustable locking mechanism that can accommodate syringes of different diameters and lengths.
    Material Consideration: Use biocompatible, durable materials that are easy to sterilize.

2. Dosing Mechanism

    Mechanical or Electronic Control: Decide between a mechanical lever system or an electronic motor to control the plunger of the syringe, allowing precise dosage control.
    Dosage Calibration: Include a mechanism to set the dosage, possibly using a dial or digital interface.

3. Activation Button

    Ergonomic Placement: Ensure the button is placed ergonomically for easy access during injection.
    Safety Features: Incorporate a safety lock or cover to prevent accidental discharge.

4. Feedback System

    Visual and Audible Indicators: Include indicators for confirming dosage delivery and system readiness or any error messages.
    Feedback on Dosage Delivery: A mechanism to confirm that the correct dose has been administered, such as a digital readout that counts down the dosage.

5. Power Supply

    Battery Powered: Consider making the device battery-powered for portability.
    Battery Life Indicator: Include a clear and accessible indicator of battery life.

6. Housing and Portability

    Compact and Lightweight Design: Ensure the device is easy to hold and manipulate during use.
    Durable Materials: Use materials that are robust and can withstand regular use in various environments.

7. Sterilization and Maintenance

    Ease of Cleaning: Design components to be easily disassembled for thorough cleaning and sterilization.
    Maintenance Alerts: Include a system to alert users when maintenance is due or if any component is malfunctioning.

8. Compliance and Safety

    Regulatory Compliance: Ensure the design meets all relevant medical device regulations.
    Testing: Plan for comprehensive testing to validate the functionality and safety of the device.
